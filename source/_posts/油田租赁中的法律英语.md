在学习Legal Writing in Plain English的时候遇到一段涉及油田租赁合同的课文，有些专有名词头一次遇到，因此专门做下记录，以备有需要时作为基础材料。

# 原文（精炼后）
这一段原本是对行文逻辑的教学，试图说明在描述问题时以时间顺序进行阐述可以给读者带来更加清晰、明确的阅读体验。

> I. Introduction
> 
> The Court of Appeals held that capability of the lease to produce *in paying quantities* does not hold an oil and gas lease after the *primary term* and that actual marketing is necessary to perpetuate the lease in the *secondary term*. The Court of Appeals’ holding is contrary to the fundamental principle of Arkansas oil and gas law that marketing is not essential to hold a lease where there is a well capable of producing in paying quantities.
> 
> The Court of Appeals’ decision will create title uncertainty in thousands of oil and gas leases in this state. As this Court is well aware, thousands of wells across Arkansas have been shut-in or substantially curtailed from time to time. Under the Court of Appeals’ decision, it will be argued that many of these currently productive and profitable Arkansas oil and gas leases terminated years ago if there was a timeframe when gas was not taken from the lease in paying quantities for the period specified in the cessation of production clause—often as short a time as sixty days. The issues of this case already affect a dozen or more cases now being litigated in Arkansas. The Court of Appeals’ decision will encourage waste of a valuable natural resource and harm lessors and lessees by requiring continuous marketing of gas even at fire-sale prices.

# 疑难解析
**in paying quantities**: 在中文中，它通常被译作“营利产量”、“超出经营费用的产量”[1] 或“足够支付（租金）的产量”。本文采取中间这种译法，因为笔者找到了Ottinger[2] 的一篇文章，其中引用Knight v. Blackwell Oil & Gas Co.[3]中法院对paying quantities的定义，指出：

> The words 'in paying quantities' can mean the production of oil or gas in such a quantity as will pay a small profit over operation costs of the well, although the expense of drilling and equipping the well may never be paid, and thus, the operation as a whole might result in a loss to the lessee. Under such circumstances, the well might be operated by the lessee, in order to recoup some of the drilling and equipment costs.
> “超出经营费用的产量”可用于表示石油或天然气产量对应的价值略超过油井的运营成本，即便这一价值可能完全不足以抵消油井开采和相关设备的费用；正是因此，整体来说，这种运营可能会导致承租人亏损。在这种情况下，可以由承租人经营油井，从而收回部分开采和设备成本。


不过，也不是达到*paying quantities*就一定能继续合同；美国各州对此存在不同要求。例如，路易斯安那州最高法院就指出，仅仅是满足超出经营费用的产量并不足以让租赁合同在“一期”届满后得到完全履行、完全生效[2]。

**primary term and secondary term**:这是油田租赁合同的特殊之处，分为两期[4]。“一期”（primary term）一般是在合同签订时就约定的固定期限，如3年；“二期”（secondary term）在“一期”届满后生效，一般以前面所说的达到超出经营费用的产量为前置条件。

不知道为什么，明明在md编辑器里用脚注语法好好的，但一到Hexo里就出问题……只好改成纯文本了，心塞。
